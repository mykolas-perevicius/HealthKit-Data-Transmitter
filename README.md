# HealthKit Data Transmitter

A Xamarin.iOS app to collect health data from Apple HealthKit and transmit it to an embedded device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Features

* Fetches health data from HealthKit (heart rate, steps, etc.)
* Utilizes a compact data serialization format for efficient transmission
* Employs BLE for power-efficient communication with an embedded device

## Project Structure

* `Shared` - Contains core logic for HealthKit access, data serialization, and Bluetooth communication.
* `Xamarin.iOS` - Houses the iOS-specific user interface and leverages the shared project.
